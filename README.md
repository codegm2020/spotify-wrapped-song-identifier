# AI-Powered Music Taste Profiler & Song Identifier
This repository contains the source code for a multifaceted mobile application prototype that combines user-centric AI personalization with deep learning-based audio analysis. The project is split into two main components:

A "Spotify Wrapped"-inspired Android App: A mobile application that securely tracks a user's listening habits and uses Google's Gemini AI to generate a detailed, personalized music taste profile.

A Music Genre Identifier: A high-accuracy Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to classify the genre of a song directly from its audio signal.

The Problem Solved

The digital music landscape is vast and saturated. While streaming services provide access to millions of songs, they often fall short in two key areas:

Lack of Deep Personalization: Beyond simple playlists, users rarely receive deep, narrative insights into their own listening habits. The "Spotify Wrapped" phenomenon proves there is a strong user desire for personalized, shareable stories about their music taste.

Content Ingestion & Categorization: For platforms and creators, manually categorizing vast libraries of music is a slow, subjective, and expensive process. An automated and accurate genre classification system is essential for music discovery, recommendations, and royalty tracking.

This project tackles both problems by creating a system for generating engaging user profiles and a robust ML model for automated audio classification.

System Architecture & Tech Stack

The project leverages a modern, cloud-native architecture for the mobile app and a standard data science pipeline for the ML model.
